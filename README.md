# Gemini Deep Research

MCP server and CLI tools for Google's Gemini Deep Research API (Interactions API).

## About

The Deep Research API is an autonomous research agent powered by Gemini 3 Pro. It:
- Plans and executes multi-step research tasks
- Iteratively searches the web via Google Search
- Synthesizes findings into comprehensive reports with citations
- Typically takes 5-15 minutes per research task

## 📄 Example Output

See **[RESEARCH_SHOWCASE.md](RESEARCH_SHOWCASE.md)** for a comprehensive demonstration of the tool's capabilities. This showcase was generated by using the Deep Research MCP Server to research the state of AI research agents—a meta-demonstration that includes:

- **Parallel research workflows**: Conducting web searches while waiting for Gemini's long-running task
- **Gemini Deep Research output**: An 8+ minute autonomous research task producing ~4,500 words with 43 sources
- **Comparative analysis**: Side-by-side comparison of different AI research approaches
- **Real-world insights**: Coverage of major players (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity), technical architectures (Agentic RAG, MCP, multi-agent systems), and future predictions

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with your API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

## Usage

```bash
# Run with default query
python deep_research.py

# Run with custom query
python deep_research.py "What is quantum computing?"
```

The script polls the Interactions API endpoint until research completes.

## API Details

- **Endpoint**: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/interactions`
- **Agent**: `deep-research-pro-preview-12-2025`
- **Execution**: Asynchronous (requires polling)

## MCP Server

This repo also includes a remote MCP server for use with Claude Desktop.

### Quick Start

1. Deploy the MCP server:
   ```bash
   cd mcp-server
   npm install
   npx wrangler login
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. Add to Claude Desktop as a custom connector:
   - **URL**: `https://deep-research-mcp.foray-consulting.workers.dev/sse`
   - Click **Connect** → Enter your Gemini API key in the form → Done!

See [mcp-server/README.md](mcp-server/README.md) for details.
